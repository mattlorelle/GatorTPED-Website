# GatorTPED-Website
Website for UF's Gator TPED club (final project CEN3031) 
Gator TPED website is a fully functional website for UF's theme park engineering and design club that acts as a platform for club members to make an account to post their projects for the world to see. It also serves as an information platform for information about the club as well as its executive board members for anyone interesteed in joining the club.

The link to the website is: https://www.gatortped.com/ No installation is needed since it is a website, is has already been deployed. Just use the link to visit it.

To run locally, the user must follow the following instructions. -Open the files in the GitHub repo in Visual Studio Code. -Open the terminal and split it. -Cd into server on one side and cd into client on the other. -Open the env file under server and replace the email address with the one you want connected to the website. -On both terminals run the following commands: npm install npm start -the website will then open up on a localhost

User functionality is pretty straight forward, but the admin account has a bit more functionality that is crucial to the website as a whole and keeping it up to date. The admin can add or remove executive board members. The admin can also delete any post.

All relevant API keys, passwords, and emails have been sent to the client.
